I set out to answer the following questions:

* How many users have only ever run 1 core jobs
* How many users have never asked for more than 40 cores?
* How many users have never used more than 4 nodes?
* How many users combined have used the same number of CPU hours as the top user?
* How many users combined have used the same number of CPU hours as the top 10 users?

* `who_uses_what_arc3.sh` - Shell script designed to be submitted to ARC3.
* `who_uses_what_arc2.sh` - Shell script designed to be submitted to ARC2.
* `users_below_top_arc2.R` - Works on the file generated by `who_uses_what_arc2.sh`
* `users_below_top_arc3.R` - Works on the file generated by `who_uses_what_arc3.sh`
